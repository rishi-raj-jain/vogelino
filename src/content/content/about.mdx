As a **JavaScript Developer**, I specialize in using a wide range of tools and technologies including _HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind, Postgres, Supabase, and more_. I am experienced in building accessible websites, writing unit tests and integration tests, setting up ci pipelines, and leveraging the power of Github actions, to ensure high quality, maintainability and performance.

In addition to my development skills, I have extensive experience in **various creative disciplines**. My background in Multimedia Design has equipped me with knowledge in _typography, graphic design, 3D, motion design, and illustration_, among other areas.

Throughout my career, I have developed my expertise in Web design, development, and interface design, accumulating multiple years of **professional experience** in those fields.
